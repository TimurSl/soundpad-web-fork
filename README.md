> Web-based remote control interface for [Soundpad](https://store.steampowered.com/app/629520/Soundpad/).<br>

## What? Why?

Soundpad is a paid `soundboard` for Windows, capable of playing media through the microphone.<br>
Hotkeys can get bound to specific sounds. However, if (like me) you are using a small keyboard or have a lot of sounds, starting sounds can quickly become frustrating.<br><br>
This project aims to simplify this by offering a remote control interface usable from a mobile device or another computer.

## Brief Description

Soundpad Web uses Soundpad's piped Remote Control Interface to send control commands to the program.<br>
Sounds are automatically fetched from Soundpad and get categorized by their parent directories.

### Extra

* Dark/light modes

## Requirements
